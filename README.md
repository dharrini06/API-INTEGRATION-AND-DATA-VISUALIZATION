DESCRIPTION:

In this project, I developed a Python script that focuses on integrating a public API with data visualization to present real-time insights. The primary goal was to fetch financial data—in this case, Bitcoin prices—from a public API (e.g., CoinDesk or CoinGecko) and use Python libraries like Matplotlib and Pandas to visualize trends and patterns. The script initiates by sending HTTP GET requests to the API, retrieving JSON data that contains daily Bitcoin prices. Once the data is fetched and parsed, it is cleaned and structured using Pandas for ease of analysis. Two key visualizations are generated in this task: the first is a line graph showing the price trend of Bitcoin over the selected timeframe, and the second is a histogram that illustrates the distribution of daily returns in percentage format. These visuals provide not only a clear picture of how the asset has performed over time but also insights into its volatility and return distribution. The script uses a modular approach with clear function definitions for fetching data, processing it, and generating plots. This ensures reusability and easy maintenance. Edge cases like missing data, API errors, and empty responses are handled gracefully to prevent runtime failures. Additionally, the visualizations are created in a dual subplot layout to ensure that users can interpret trends and distribution simultaneously without needing to toggle between different graphs. This task demonstrates proficiency in API integration, real-time data handling, and fundamental data visualization techniques, making it an essential stepping stone for projects involving dashboards or financial analytics. The deliverable includes the Python script and the generated visual output, fulfilling the internship requirements for data collection, processing, and visualization.
